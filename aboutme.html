    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>1. I am working to become a psychologist in my professional life. I originally became interested in the topic because of my mother. Its always something she wanted to pursue, but never fully committed to. As I began to read psychology books and studies, I found myself becoming interested.

2. I am working towards these goals by attempting my best effort in all academic activities. Studying for tests, as well as taking high level courses in the future.

3. The values that I consider important for my success is perseverance and determination. Being able to work to accomplish something no matter the hardships in how you become successful.

4. The short-term goals I have in mind are to keep my grades good and become involved in other things outside of school.

5. I want to be known as someone who helps people. Especially now, too many people are experiencing horrible things and those people deserve to be happy like others.</p>
